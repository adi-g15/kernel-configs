## Kernel Configs (x86_64)

These are the kernel configs i use on one of my systems, **if not stated, x86_64 architecture is implied**

Generally with each version, there are lesser/same number of modules.

My system config:
* OS: arch+systemd
* Ram: 8GB
* CPU: Ryzen 5 3500U
* Wifi, Bluetooth works with all newer configs
